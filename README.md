# BattGui
A python based GUI for Batt
## About Batt
`batt` is a tool to control battery charging on Apple Silicon. To continue utilizing this program, it is imperative to follow the prescribed documentation available at the following link: [https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/charlie0129/batt/blob/master/README.md).

## Why do you need this
In contrast to existing proprietary programs like AIDente, batt is a fully command-line based open-source program. For novice users who prefer not to pay for other closed-source programs but still desire to utilize its functionality, the command-line interface can be somewhat challenging. Therefore, the author intends to simplify the process by designing a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) to directly interact with batt, making it more accessible for beginners to conveniently utilize Batt.

## About BattGui
Currently, the program only supports the functionality of adjusting the charging limit through the ‘batt limit’ command. Additional commands will be added in future updates.

## Update
Dec 4, 2023: Inaugural submission of BattGui, successfully implementing the functionality to regulate the charging upper limit.
